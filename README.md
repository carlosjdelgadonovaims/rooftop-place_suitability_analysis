# Rooftop-Place Suitability Analysis for Urban Air Mobility Hubs
This repository is part of the research thesis development called **_Rooftop-Place Suitability Analysis for Urban Air Mobility Hubs: A GIS and Neural Network Approach_** for the [Erasmus Mundus Masters in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/).

This thesis seeks to carry out an integral rooftop place suitability analysis by involving both the essential variables of the urban ecosystem and the adequate rooftop surfaces for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operability.
