# Rooftop-Place Suitability Analysis for Urban Air Mobility Hubs
This repository is part of the research thesis development called **_Rooftop-Place Suitability Analysis for Urban Air Mobility Hubs: A GIS and Neural Network Approach_** for the [Erasmus Mundus Masters in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/).

This thesis seeks to carry out an integral rooftop place suitability analysis by involving both the essential variables of the urban ecosystem and the adequate rooftop surfaces for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operability.

The study area selected for this research is Manhattan (New York, U.S), which is the most densely populated metropolitan area of one of the megacities in the world. The applied methodology has an unsupervised-data-driving and GIS-based approach, which is covered in three sections. The first part is responsible for analyzing the suitability of place when evaluating spatial patterns given by the application of Self-Organizing Maps on the urban ecosystem variables attached to the city census blocks. The second part is based on the development of an algorithm in Python for the evaluation of both the flatness of the roof surfaces and to classify the type of UAM platform suitable for its settlement.

Therefore, the codes stored in this repositories are related to these three main research stages:
1. Proximity Features Extraction
2. Rooftop Statistics Calculation
3. Rooftop Flatness Assessment

## 1. Proximity Features Extraction
